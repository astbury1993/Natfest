            <h2>The Reason Behind Natfest, by Kellen</h2>
            <p>In 2023, our Mum, Natalie, sadly passed away at LOROS after battling lung cancer. The day before her 60th birthday.
This was the most horrendous day of mine, my sisters (Gemma & Charlotte) and my dad’s life.</p>
            <p>Our only comfort is knowing how well she was cared for in those last few days. The team at LOROS were nothing short of incredible. Completely attentive to her needs and they went above and beyond to care for not only her, but all of us too.</p>
            <p>I think mum would think we’ve lost our marbles arranging a festival in her honour 😅 but her passion was music, having been to many festivals herself and being a huge lover of bands in general.</p>
            <p>Natfest honours not only mum, but everyone who has been under the care of LOROS and I’m sure many of you will have had friends and family need them.</p> 
            <p>We really hope that by raising money we can make a real difference to families that unfortunately need the help of LOROS in the future. </p>
            <p>❤️💛🩷💚🧡💙🩵</p>
