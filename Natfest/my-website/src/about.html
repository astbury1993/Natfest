                <p>Festivals were always a passion of Natalie's and mine, and the thought of doing my own is the ultimate bucket list goal! Mind you, Nat would be saying I'm mad! However I've assembled a team of what I believe to be te best in the business to give you the ultimate experience whilst raising money for the charity closest to mine and many other's hearts, Loros. You won't want to miss this, if you haven't got your ticket yet what are you waiting for?</p>
                <p>For those of you who don’t know who I am, I’ll be the one running round every where like a madman, making sure everything is running smoothly, so you can have the best festival experience, and go home feeling like you’ve had the best time.
Glastonbury, what’s Glastonbury 🤪
Natfest all the way🤘</p>

                <p>Hi everyone! I’m your point of contact for all things tickets and information! Im also looking after the social media side of things with my sidekick Amelie! I’ll be bringing the festival right to your front door whether that be sending out the physical tickets to choosing the acts we announce in the background for social media broadcast 🥳 so for all questions Natfest related please holla 📞

I’m trying my hardest to bring a pets corner to the festival, (just for the Guinea pigs 🐹) if not you’ll see me sliding down the bouncy castle after a few espresso martinis 🤪 5th July can’t come soon enough!!</p>
