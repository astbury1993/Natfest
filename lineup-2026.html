                <h3>SKA TRAIN</h3>
                <p>
    <strong>Ska Train</strong> celebrate the UK ska revival of the late 1970s and early 80s, a movement pioneered by Jerry Dammers’ iconic <em>2-Tone</em> record label. This era brought us legendary bands like <strong>The Specials</strong>, <strong>Madness</strong>, <strong>Bad Manners</strong>, and <strong>The Selecter</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The band’s seven-piece line-up features spine-tingling horns (trombone and saxophone) and a rock-solid rhythm section, with guitar, keys, and vocals that transport audiences back to an explosive musical era of punk, politics, and messages of peace.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since 2023, Ska Train have:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Established a record-breaking run of sold-out dates at Leamington’s award-winning <strong>Temperance Music Bar</strong></li>
    <li>Supported US ska-punk band <strong>Monkey</strong> on their UK tour</li>
    <li>Performed live on stage with former members of <strong>The Specials</strong></li>
    <li>Headlined festivals including <strong>Congleton Jazz and Blues Festival</strong>, <strong>MurphFest</strong>, <strong>Astonbury</strong>, and <strong>Art in the Park</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    So if you’ve ever set sail in a <em>Night Boat To Cairo</em>, gazed at your <em>Mirror In The Bathroom</em>, or simply done <em>Too Much Too Young</em>, get on board the <strong>Ska Train</strong> now for an unforgettable live musical journey that will truly take you <em>One Step Beyond...</em>

                <h3>Szyslak</h3>
                <p>Ay up, we’re Szyslak from Leicester - a 2-piece grungy garage rock/rock n roll band with punk influences (whatever that means!!). Writing songs is hard, so instead we cover obscure and classic songs from the 1920s through to the 1960s, ranging from blues, rock n roll, RnB, soul, motown and gospel, but we do them in our own raucous, heavy, silly way.</p>

                <p>We played Natfest last year and had such a blast! We’re very stoked to be playing again this year, we’re looking forward to playing a set of new songs for you.</p>

                <p>We’re pretty crazy though, we’ve been known to drink 2 or 3 beers before we play!!! Sometimes a shot of a Kahlúa! Crazy…</p>
