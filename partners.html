  <h2>Our Partners</h2>
  <p>
    Behind every unforgettable moment at our charity fundraising music festival stands a powerful partnership rooted in purpose and generosity. We’re proud to support and be supported by two incredible organisations whose commitment makes this event possible.
  </p>

  <h3>🎗 LOROS Hospice</h3>
  <p>
    At the heart of our mission is LOROS, a local charity providing compassionate care and support to terminally ill patients and their families across Leicestershire and Rutland. Every note played and every pound raised helps fund their vital work, bringing comfort and dignity when it’s needed most.

  <h3>🏞 Alpha Power Cleaners</h3>
  <p>
    Our festival wouldn’t have a stage to stand on without the unwavering support of Chris Freeman and Alpha Power Cleaners. Not only do they sponsor the event, they also host it on their land—transforming their grounds into a vibrant celebration of music, community, and giving.
  </p>

  <p>
    Together, LOROS and Alpha Power Cleaners help us turn sound into support, and rhythm into hope. We’re honoured to have them by our side.
